# Computer Graphics Coursework

This is my submission for the Computer Graphics coursework of the Software Methodologies module at Durham University, 2019.

#### Build

The build process is based off that implemented (here)[https://github.com/oliverbenns/webgl-starter]. This uses Webpack 
to serve a single bundled JS file, transpiled from ES6, and also facilitates live reloading.
